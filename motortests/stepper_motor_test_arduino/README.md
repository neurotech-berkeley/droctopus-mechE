Arduino BLE Sense pinout: https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/nano-33-ble-sense/

Unfortuantely the Arduino BLE Sense doesn't have a 5V output which the DM332T driver needs, but this code could be used with an Ardunio UNO (which I will test later). 

The code for the Arduino UNO is MUCH simpler than the code for the ESP32-based boards.
